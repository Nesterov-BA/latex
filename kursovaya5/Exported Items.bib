	abstract = {In classical geometrodynamics, one is led to a configuration space, S(M), which is a stratified Frechet manifold. In quantum geometrodynamics, one must allow the underlying topology to fluctuate. In fact, the fluctuations of the topology and metric will be so violent that the resulting spaces will seem foam like. This chapter discusses the superspace S of isometry classes of compact metric spaces and discusses that one can define a natural metric D on S. It also describes some of the properties of the metric space (S,D). A usual assumption of classical cosmology is that space is a Riemannian 3-sphere whose metric is close to the standard metric. If one assumes that in quantum cosmology the probability measure is concentrated near S3 in the metric D, then one has the prediction that, with very high probability, space will be a foamy 3-sphere.},
